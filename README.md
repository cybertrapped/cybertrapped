- 👋 Hi, I’m @cybertrapped (a.k.a. Veronica Cisneros)
- 👀 I’m working very hard on shaking off persistent targetted hacking and coordinated harassment. I am in a precarious state... 
- 🌱 I’m currently trying to publish as much information as I can, becasue I think the perpetrators may be, in the best case, rogue government employees, in the worst case scenario, authorized government employees who are braking the law to get to whatever it is they are trying to get from me and do to me
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how set up tangible help for victims of persistent targeted hacking attacks
- 📫 How to reach me: twitter @cybertrapped
